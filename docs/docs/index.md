# ðŸ”Ž Overview

APIRequest (APIR) is a plugin for the note taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows you to make requests to apis display the response in your notes.

## ðŸ”¥ Features

- Perform requests using various methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
- Use variables from the `front-matter`, global variables or even reuse responses from another codeblocks.
- Save responses in the `localStorage` for convenient access and reuse.
- Disable code blocks as needed to optimize performance.
- Extract and display specific values from responses, giving you fine-grained control over how data is presented.

## âš¡ How to use

To make a request, create a code-block with the language set to `req`. Inside the code-block, you can define parameters such as `url`, `method`, `body`, `headers`, etc. See the [available flags](en/codeblocks#flags) for a complete reference.
